### The agent fleet that survives a reboot.

Fan out one prompt into **N isolated agents** — each in its own git worktree — review their work **hunk by hunk**, and walk away: after a quit, crash, or **full OS reboot**, your agents come back mid-conversation. A native Windows terminal for **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, and **Gemini CLI**, with **verified sender identity**, **human approval gates**, and a real browser agents can drive.

> **Windows has no native tmux.** Without WSL there was no clean way to run several AI coding agents at once. wmux is a native Windows multiplexer + browser automation + MCP server, purpose-built so your agents **read the terminal, drive a real browser, and run in parallel — all in one window.**

## 🤔 Why wmux?

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 🧵 **One prompt → N agents → merge the best** | Fan out a prompt into up to 8 tasks, each in an **isolated git worktree** with its own agent pane and a private mission channel. Review each task's diff side by side, **adopt hunks all-or-nothing**, then close it or open a **PR in one click** — leftovers land in a cleanup list, never as mystery folders. |
| 🪟 **Many agents, one window** | Split panes + workspaces. Claude on the left, Codex on the right, Gemini running tests below — simultaneously. |
| 🤝 **Agents coordinate, not just coexist** | Agent-to-agent messaging + task delegation, plus **channels** — Slack-style rooms several agents read, post, and get @-mentioned into. An **execute approval gate** stops any agent running code in your workspace without your OK. This is the multi-agent moat. |
| 🌐 **Agents drive a *real* browser** | Built-in Chrome over CDP. Say *"search Google for this"* and your agent actually clicks, types, and screenshots. Works with React inputs and CJK text. |
| 🧭 **Fleet View cockpit** | `Ctrl+Shift+A` — every agent across every workspace in an **always-on side panel** (other panes stay live), blocked ones floated to the top with a live activity line. Clear every stuck approval from one **inbox**; click any card to jump straight there. |
| 🔔 **Knows when an agent finishes** | Desktop notification + taskbar flash on completion. Flags `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE` for your approval. |
| 💾 **Survives quit, crash & reboot** | A tmux-style daemon owns every PTY. Reopen and your sessions are **still running — processes and all.** A pane declared in `wmux.json` is **supervised like an init system** — auto-restarted across crashes and reboots (the app relaunches at login), resuming the *exact* Claude conversation it was on. |
| 🤖 **Zero-config MCP** | Launch wmux and Claude Code just works — browser + terminal tools register automatically. |

## ✨ Highlights

- 🧵 **Task fan-out & harvest** — one prompt → N worktree-isolated tasks (idempotent, per-task compensation) · side-by-side diff with **hunk adoption** (all-or-nothing `git apply`) · close / one-click PR / cleanup list · mission channels record every decision
- 🤝 **A2A multi-agent** — agents message + delegate tasks by pane, gated by a per-pane execute approval, with a pollable task inbox + symmetric reply
- 💬 **Channels** — Slack-style rooms agents read, post, and get @-mentioned into · server-verified sender · durable per-agent inbox · `wmux channel` CLI · operators can self-join private agent rooms (audited)
- 🤖 **Agent supervision** — declare a pane in `wmux.json` (trust-gated) and the daemon keeps it alive: restart policy, backoff, reboot survival
- 🖥️ **ConPTY + xterm.js WebGL** rendering · 999K-line scrollback · Unicode 11 (correct CJK / emoji)
- ⌨️ **Tmux-style prefix** (`Ctrl+B` + key, 13 actions) · **floating pane** (`` Ctrl+` ``) · scroll bookmarks
- 🔀 **Multiview** — several workspaces side by side · layout templates · drag-to-reorder sidebar
- 🧩 **Plugin host** — sandboxed iframe plugins with an explicit permission model
- 🛡️ **Token-authed IPC**, SSRF guard, PTY input sanitization, randomized CDP port, Electron Fuses
- 🎨 Catppuccin Mocha · Monochrome · Sandstone &nbsp;·&nbsp; 🌏 **23 locales scaffolded** — English & 한국어 complete, 日本語 / 中文 in progress — **[translations welcome](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/labels/good%20first%20issue)**

> 💡 **Tip:** point Claude Code at the MCP tools (`browser_open`, `terminal_read`, `pane_list`, `a2a_task_send`, `channel_post`) or script the `wmux` CLI (`wmux send` / `read-screen` / `list-panes` / `wmux channel post`) to orchestrate panes programmatically.

<br>

**Terminal** — xterm.js + WebGL, ConPTY native PTY, Unicode 11 width tables, split panes, tabs, floating pane, smart right-click (selection→copy / empty→paste / link menu), scroll bookmarks, Vi copy mode, regex search, 999K scrollback with disk persistence, shell integration (OSC 133) for semantic command boundaries (Constrained Language Mode safe).

**Keybindings** — Tmux-style prefix mode (`Ctrl+B`, 13 default actions), fully customizable, reset-to-defaults.

**Workspaces** — drag-and-drop sidebar, `Ctrl+1~9` quick switch, multiview, layout templates, full session persistence (layout / tabs / cwd / scrollback), Fleet View cockpit.

**Browser + CDP** — built-in panel (`Ctrl+Shift+L`), nav bar / DevTools / back-forward, element Inspector (hover-highlight, click-to-copy LLM context), full automation: click / fill / type / screenshot / JS eval / key press.

**Notifications** — output-throughput activity detection (not pattern matching, works with any agent), taskbar flash + Windows toasts, process-exit alerts, notification panel (`Ctrl+I`), Web Audio cues.

**Agent detection** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI. Detects start → activates monitoring, warns on critical actions.

**Task journey (fan-out → diff → PR)** — spawn up to 8 `WorkTask` missions from one prompt, each with a dedicated git worktree on a fresh `wtask/*` branch, its own task workspace, a private mission channel, and a file-backed initial prompt. Idempotency-keyed end to end; per-task failures compensate individually, and worktrees are preserved — never force-deleted. Harvest through a diff surface (file tree, unified diff, per-hunk checkboxes; adoption is a single all-or-nothing `git apply` gated by a target snapshot so the target is fully changed or fully untouched), comment straight into the mission channel, then close the task (the worktree is removed only after a clean check — dirty output is preserved and the close is held) or open a PR with one click (`gh`-gated, idempotent re-entry). A palette cleanup list scans the worktree root for leftovers, and missions show up in the sidebar and fleet panel.

**Multi-agent (A2A)** — agent-to-agent messaging + task delegation addressed by pane/surface, same-workspace and cross-workspace. Per-pane **execute approval gate** (a remote agent can't spawn a `bypassPermissions` worker in your workspace without your approval). Symmetric reply (a reply returns to the exact pane that asked), pollable task inbox on the EventBus, broadcast, and a unified approval inbox in Fleet View.

**Channels** — Slack-style rooms for a workspace's agents: create / join / invite / post / read / archive, each message carrying a server-verified sender — shown as the sender's pane identity chip plus a per-workspace color badge, so you can tell agents apart at a glance. A durable per-member inbox (unread + @-mention counts, survives reboot), a human-readable right-side dock, and a headless `wmux channel` CLI (`unread` / `read` / `post` / `ack` / `join` / `list`) so a nudged agent can catch up and reply.

**Supervision & wmux.json** — declare panes/agents in a trust-gated `wmux.json` (auto-layout + custom commands). The daemon supervises declared agent panes like an init system: restart policy with backoff across process exits, daemon restarts, and full reboots, with a runaway-crash guard — and it resumes the exact agent conversation on restart, not a fresh shell.

**Plugins** — sandboxed iframe plugin host with a bridge + explicit permission model and pane decorations.

**Daemon** — background session management (survives app restart), scrollback dump + auto-recovery, Windows startup registration (relaunches at login after reboot), dead-session TTL reaping.

**MCP tools** — `browser_*` (open / navigate / screenshot / snapshot / click / fill / type / evaluate / press_key), `terminal_read` / `terminal_read_events` (OSC 133) / `terminal_send` / `terminal_send_key`, `workspace_list` / `surface_list` / `surface_new` / `pane_list` / `pane_split` / `pane_close` / `pane_focus`, `channel_*` (create / post / read / ack / invite / join / list), `a2a_*` agent-to-agent + task delegation, `company_a2a_*`, `wmux_events_poll` / `wmux_search_panes`. Every browser tool takes a `surfaceId` so each session drives its own browser.

<summary><b>❓ &nbsp;FAQ + install troubleshooting</b></summary>

<br>

**Is wmux a tmux port?** No — it's a native Windows multiplexer on ConPTY + Electron with tmux-*style* split panes, prefix keys, and session persistence. No WSL / Cygwin / MSYS2.

**Works with Claude Code / Codex / Gemini?** Yes. wmux auto-detects them and registers an MCP server so they can drive the browser and read terminal output.

**Multiple agents at once?** Yes. Each pane is an independent PTY, and agents coordinate over A2A MCP tools — message each other, delegate tasks by pane, reply to the exact pane that asked, and gate any cross-agent code execution behind your approval.

**"Windows protected your PC" warning?** The installer isn't Authenticode-signed yet (free signing via [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) / [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) is being set up), so SmartScreen flags an unknown publisher. It's safe — click **More info → Run anyway**, or install via **winget** / **Chocolatey** to skip the prompt.

**Installer blocked with no "Run anyway"?** **Smart App Control (SAC)** on Windows 11 can block unsigned binaries outright. Check with `Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object SmartAppControlState`. SAC uses cloud reputation, so blocks are often transient — retry later, use winget/choco, or build from source ([#200](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/issues/200)).

**PowerShell one-liner** (downloads the prebuilt Setup.exe, verifies SHA-256, no build tools):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwong2kim/wmux/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

## 🛠️ Build from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux.git
cd wmux
npm install
npm start          # dev mode
npm run make       # build installer
```

Requires Node 18+, Python 3.x, and VS Build Tools (C++ workload). `WMUX_FROM_SOURCE=1 irm …/install.ps1 | iex` auto-installs them.
